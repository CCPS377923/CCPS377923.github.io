<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>What I'm working towards in my personal and professional life is to always work hard even when I don't want to, I've had experiences where I didn't do my work and I was failing my class but the I was like what is that benefiting me in the future I should be able to get my work done so I can achieve something big and become something in life. I will be working towards these goals by getting a job, getting good grades, finish my class assignments, and to graduate high school. What I consider for my success is to be financially stable and be in a good environment. A goal that I want to accomplish in the near future is to buy a car for myself and to be able to buy a house and to have a really good income in the future. I want to be known as  very persistent and honest and very loyal because I am all those things.</p>
